**About StateMachine**
A State Machine is a computational model used to design and represent the logic of systems that transition between different states based on inputs or conditions.

Components of a State Machine: 
1. States:
    The various conditions or configurations the system can be in.
    Represented as nodes in a state diagram.
   
2. Transitions:
    The rules or triggers that move the system from one state to another.
    Often represented as directed edges between states in a diagram.

3. Initial State:
    The state in which the system starts.

4. Actions:
    Operations or outputs associated with entering, exiting, or being in a state.

5. Final/End State (optional):
    A state that represents the completion of the system's execution.

6. Events:
    External or internal inputs that cause transitions between states.


Applications: 
1. Software Development: Workflow engines, parsers, and user interface logic.
2. Electronics: Control systems, communication protocols, IOT.
3. Game Development: Character or enemy behavior.
4. Robotics: Navigation and task execution.
5. Process Automation: Business process management.
